# Implementation ledger

## Workspace

User chose in-place implementation on feature branch feat/chess-engine. Original checkout clean; only README existed. SDK 10.0.402 installed. User authorized restore, builds and tests; publish and Docker image builds are not authorized.

## Preflight rulings

- No OpenSpec root exists (openspec list --json returned root: null). Auto-selected workflow explicitly prohibits initializing one without a user request. The supplied plan is the behavioral source of truth.
- Libraries expose Core types transitively through Engine. Adapters reference Engine only.
- Position is a mutable reference type owning fixed undo/history arrays; evaluator accepts it by readonly reference. Moves remain 16-bit values.
- Benchmark signature uses a bounded default depth so CI remains practical; deeper depth is selectable.

## Evidence

- Preparation: clean empty repository, .NET 10 SDK available.
